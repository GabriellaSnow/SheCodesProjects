# SheCodesProjects
A collection of projects created while on the SheCodes Course

'First Project' is the first project I created while on the SheCodes course. Here you can see I used a variety of techniques to build a landing page with HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
The main focus of this page was to show how the user can interact with the button and prompt to change the image of the moon on the page as well as information about the moon displayed. 

AddOn Project is a one page webpage project that focused on the dark mode/light mode switch using Javascript. The content is about music.
